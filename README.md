# ArrowGame
A stupid little game I made in high school. You have to press the arrow key corresponding to the direction of the arrow while time runs up. This was back when I still thought jQuery is cool.


## How to play?
open ArrowGame.html in Browser. Press the arrow key in the direction indicated by the arrow before the time runs up. Try to get as many points as possible.
